* Add comand to interrogate the image for available raw data and GCR blocks
	Like BAM but better.



* Add a command to locate all start block chains, look at all blocks and trace them backwards.
	This will need a table of where blocks point to, a reverse lookup.
	Use this to show the "what should be marked as allocated" map.
	Add the option to automatically save these chains as filenames using the start track/sector ad a filename.
